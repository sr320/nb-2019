Bismark report for: /Users/sr320/Desktop/oly/zr1394_1_s456_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.21.0)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/sr320/Desktop/oly/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.9 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	1000
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	489
Mapping efficiency:	48.9%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	4
Sequences did not map uniquely:	507
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	108	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	109	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	121	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	151	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
