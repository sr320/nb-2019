Bismark report for: /Users/sr320/Desktop/geo/EPI-42_S39_L005_R1_001_val_1.fq and /Users/sr320/Desktop/geo/EPI-42_S39_L005_R2_001_val_2.fq (version: v0.21.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/sr320/Desktop/v074/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	4450
Mapping efficiency:	44.5% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	4264
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1286
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	2058	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	105	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	119	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	2168	((converted) bottom strand)
